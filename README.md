# Assignment
1) Fork the Project
2) Create the page depicted in design comp: Product-Details.jpg. It is not necessary to translate everything into markup at this
point, if time is limited you may use image slices for elements where it makes sense.
2) Referencing the Product-Details-Flyout-Submenu.jpg design comp, create a fly-out submenu on the Clothing element of
the primary navigation. Bonus for utilizing css transitions.
3) Referencing the attached Product-Review-Modal.jpg design comp, create a modal window containing a form that allows
the visitor to write a review for the product, which is launched from the Write a review of this Product hyperlink on the
Product Details page. This can be a dummy form; it is not required to save the product review. The modal window should close
when the user clicks “Submit Review”.
4) Make sure the website passes all accessibility requirements
5) Deploy your final project using github.
